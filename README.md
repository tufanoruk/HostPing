# HostPing

Pings given IP / hostname and returns hostname / IP and delay. Used to check (reverse)DNS lookup and accesibility of the target. (Yes, all can be done via CLI ping command. This is a simple technology integration project)

Utilizes Apache, bootstrap, JS, Perl and a small C program to invoke Perl script w/ setuid.

1. Modify "httpd-hostping.conf" according to your directory structure.

Notes for Apache http configuration ;
